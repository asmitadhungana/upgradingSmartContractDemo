# upgradingSmartContractDemo
This is a repository for the demonstration presentation I gave for upgrading smart contracts with Openzeppelin on Ibriz.ai

Here, you'll have to check the commits and compare them to get the idea about the changes made in between various upgardes.

The first two previous upgrades have been made using the CLI and the last commit is for the upgrade done programmatically!
